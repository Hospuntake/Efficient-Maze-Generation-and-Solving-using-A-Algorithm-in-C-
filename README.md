# Efficient-Maze-Generation-and-Solving-using-A-Algorithm-in-C-
This C++ program focuses on creating mazes and solving them efficiently using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is a heuristic-based search algorithm that guarantees finding the shortest path in a maze. The code is designed with an object-oriented approach for clarity and modularity.
