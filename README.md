This C++ program focuses on creating mazes and solving them efficiently using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is a heuristic-based search algorithm that guarantees finding the shortest path in a maze. The code is designed with an object-oriented approach for clarity and modularity.

### Features:

- **Maze Generation:**
  - The program generates mazes of customizable dimensions.
  - Maze creation ensures solvability and employs randomness.

- **A* Algorithm:**
  - Efficient maze-solving is achieved through the implementation of the A* algorithm.
  - A* uses heuristic information to intelligently navigate through the maze, finding the optimal path.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**
  - The code follows object-oriented principles, enhancing organization and ease of use.
  - Classes encapsulate relevant functionality without being explicitly mentioned.

- **File Handling:**
  - File handling is implemented for reading and writing maze configurations.
  - Mazes can be saved to files for future use, and existing mazes can be loaded.
